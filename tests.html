                <li>Geo Filtering gives an administrator the ability to block traffic sourced from OR destined to specific countries and geograhic regions.  In this test, we are testing your brower's connectivity to tabao.com, a site which is hosted in China.</li><br>
                <li>Also a function of NGFW, Geo Filtering relies on an internal database of IP address to Geolocation mapping.  When a session is initiated from a host machine and transits the NGFW device, the firewall will take a look at the source and destination IP addresses.  From here, if Geo IP Filtering is enabled, then the NGFW will compare the source and destionation IPs of the session to its database checking for matches against the policy set.</li><br>
                <li>Initially, Geo IP filtering was limited to country or region.  With newer firewalls, the datasbases have been updated to match on more granular locations such as city and state</li><br>
                <li>If you see a green checkmark, then you are currently blocking this connectivity.  If a red checkmark is shown, then your browser was successfully connect to a site hosted in China (tabao.com).</li><br>

            <li>Application filtering requires Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) technology.  Appliances with NGFW capabilities will have built in app-id engines, that typically consider things like destination IP, port/protocol, initial handshake behaviors, and packet size to match against a list of predefined applications and their known behaviors.  Most NGFW come with thousands of predefined applications, but also support the ability to custom define app-match criteria for homegrown applications.</li><br>

                <li>URL Filtering can typically be enforced without the need for SSL decryption, as NGFW will have access to a database where they can compare the "Server Name Indicator" to a list categorized SNIs.</li><br>
                <li>SNI is transmitted as part of the Client Hello message in the TLS handshake.  This field is typically plain text/unencrypted</li><br>
                <li>Some newer sites support "Encrypted SNI" or "eSNI".  This would render URL filtering ineffective if you did not have some sort of TLS decryption in place.</li><br>
