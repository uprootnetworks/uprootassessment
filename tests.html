                <li>Also a function of NGFW, Geo Filtering relies on an internal database of IP address to Geolocation mapping.  When a session is initiated from a host machine and transits the NGFW device, the firewall will take a look at the source and destination IP addresses.  From here, if Geo IP Filtering is enabled, then the NGFW will compare the source and destionation IPs of the session to its database checking for matches against the policy set.</li><br>
                <li>Initially, Geo IP filtering was limited to country or region.  With newer firewalls, the datasbases have been updated to match on more granular locations such as city and state</li><br>
                <li>If you see a green checkmark, then you are currently blocking this connectivity.  If a red checkmark is shown, then your browser was successfully connect to a site hosted in China (tabao.com).</li><br>

                <li>URL Filtering can typically be enforced without the need for SSL decryption, as NGFW will have access to a database where they can compare the "Server Name Indicator" to a list categorized SNIs.</li><br>

            <li>In this test, we are attempting to download an EICAR test file over a TLS/SSL encrypted session.  Most modern web traffic is TLS encrypted, meaning you will need a solution which can handle SSL decryption in order to stop the downloading of malicious content over https. We are using eicar.org/eicar.com to test.</li><br>
            <li>Without SSL decryption, users are able to download any files over https as that session would otherwise be encrypted end to end.</li><br>
            <li>SSL decryption requires a firewall to decrypt user's sessions, inspect the payload, and re encrypt the session before passing to the client/server.  To do this, a trusted certficate must be installed on both the firewall and the host machine.</li><br>
